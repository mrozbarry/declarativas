# Legacy implementation

In the not so distant past, I had been working on [cool your jets](https://github.com/mrozbarry/cool-your-jets).
It's a neat game, and I wanted to see if inside of it, I could render my game declaratively.
This is the result of that.

After some thought, I concluded that I wanted to pull it out and design an application system that could run this game (or others).
